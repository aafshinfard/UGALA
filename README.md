# UGALA: Ultrafast Genome Alignment with Limited Anchoring.

## Under Private Developement, will be released as Open-source.

See manual.txt to use the code along with bowtie or any other read aligner to run the main cycle of the algorithm for now.

This was a part of an accepted Master's Thesis (A+ - 19.5/20) in CS, AI at Shrif University of Technology by Amirhossein Afshinfard.

## Features

* Very fast alignment and homology reporting by comparing only a small proportion of the input genomes.

* PAC bounded accuracy. 

* Working for different resolution and thus with different speeds.

* E.g: 260x faster than a simple blast when searching for > 25kb rearrangements.
